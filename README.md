# **We Are Number One.**

A team based problem solving group at Imperial College London.

## Data Files
We have been given a lot of files for this project (3.20GB). To reduce the time it takes for the initial pull, we would like everyone to individually store their .csv files in a folder called `Data` in the `TBPSWeAreNumberOne` Folder locally on your PC. You should have the `TBPSWeAreNumberOne` folder if you have cloned the repository onto your PC.

As long as you name the folder `Data`, git will automatically ignore that folder when you push to a branch providing the file, [.gitignore](.gitignore), is on your PC. If it is not on your PC, please perform:
```cmd
git pull origin main
```
For all scripts made, please use this folder to load in data - this will make it extremely easy for everyone to run scripts without changing where files are located on their PC.
